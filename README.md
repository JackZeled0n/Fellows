# Fellows

List of TCI fellows from <a href="collegeinstitute.net">College institute</a> getting information from google spreadsheet as database. 

### How it's works
Publish in the web the spreadsheet, take the id and put it in this url:

https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/list/id/1/public/values?alt=json

This let it convert to json format for reading in javascript and show it in HTML with <a href="https://datatables.net/">datatables</a>
